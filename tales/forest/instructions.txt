StoryCraft
==========

An engine for text games focused on story tales.


To create a new story you use text files which
follow a simple syntax. The simplicity of text
files permits you to play from any kind of
machine.

From old 80s computers to modern web browsers
and just about anything else in between. One
of the nice features is to permit multiplayer
games across the internet.


For now just focus on writing tales, have fun! :-)

-----------------------

#Syntax


## File names and folders

Every file uses the extension .tale to know that
it belongs to the game. You can place them in any
subfolders to help organizing, just remember to
always use slashes in unix-style to mention them.

For example:
'''
rooms/castle_wolf.tale
'''


# Actions

Specific activities that give life to the game


## wait

Waits for a specific number of seconds to create
suspense before the next action takes place.

Example:
'''
wait 10
'''


## open

Opens a specific location tale.

Starts running all the commands from the beginning
of the file until the end.

'''
open castle-blue.tale
open bonus/hidden-cave1.tale
'''


## options

Adds options to the command that will run next.

The type of options depends on the command.

An option consists of a KEY=VALUE statement.
Multiple options are separated by spaces.


## story

Tells a short story to the user. this text can
be displayed progressively depending on the options.

'''
options letter_speed=0.2
story Once upon a time there was a princess on a far.. far.. far kingdom (...)
'''

Options this command:
+ letter_speed: how fast each letter is displayed in seconds
+ pause_after_space: defines seconds for pausing after each space letter
